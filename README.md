# EEG_Prediction

Trailer_audio_similarities.ipynb:
- Audio feature extraction
- Feature comparison heatmaps
- Feature plotting as a function of time

Trailer_visual_similarities.ipynb:
- Video feature extraction
- Feature comparison heatmaps
- Feature plotting as a function of time

Note that the graphs yielded from the above notebooks are to verify that extraction worked properly and must be refined if used for direct analysis.
